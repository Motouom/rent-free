# House Rental Platform Documentation

## Overview

The **House Rental Platform** is a modern, responsive, and user-friendly web application for renting houses. The platform serves two primary user groups: tenants (users looking to rent properties) and property owners (users managing rental listings). The goal is to provide an efficient and enjoyable experience for both groups, using a robust, scalable, and maintainable technology stack.
